        <h2>
          Google Chrome Terms of Service
        </h2>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service apply to the executable code version of Google Chrome. Source code
          for Google Chrome is available free of charge under open source software license
          agreements at http://code.google.com/chromium/terms.html.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Your relationship with Google</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          1.1 Your use of Google’s products, software, services and web sites (referred to
          collectively as the “Services” in this document and excluding any services provided to
          you by Google under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal
          agreement between you and Google. “Google” means Google Inc., whose principal place of
          business is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States. This
          document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that
          agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Google, your agreement with Google will
          always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These
          are referred to below as the “Universal Terms”. Open source software licenses for Google
          Chrome source code constitute separate written agreements. To the limited extent that the
          open source software licenses expressly supersede these Universal Terms, the open source
          licenses govern your agreement with Google for the use of Google Chrome or specific
          included components of Google Chrome.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.3 Your agreement with Google will also include the terms set forth below in the Google
          Chrome Additional Terms of Service and terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the
          Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the
          “Additional Terms”. Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible
          for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding
          agreement between you and Google in relation to your use of the Services. It is important
          that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is
          referred to below as the “Terms”.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the
          Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that
          Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Accepting the Terms</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          2.1 In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use the
          Services if you do not accept the Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.2 You can accept the Terms by:
        </p>
        <p>
          (A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you
          by Google in the user interface for any Service; or
        </p>
        <p>
          (B) by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that Google
          will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Language of the Terms</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          3.1 Where Google has provided you with a translation of the English language version of
          the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and
          that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with
          Google.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.2 If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms
          says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take
          precedence.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4. Provision of the Services by Google</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          4.1 Google has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world (“Subsidiaries
          and Affiliates”). Sometimes, these companies will be providing the Services to you on
          behalf of Google itself. You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will
          be entitled to provide the Services to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.2 Google is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for
          its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which
          Google provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.3 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Google may stop
          (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services)
          to you or to users generally at Google’s sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
          You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform
          Google when you stop using the Services.

          privacy policy at http://www.google.com/privacy.html and at
          http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/privacy.html. This policy explains how Google treats

          <strong>7. Content in the Services</strong>

        <p>
          7.1 You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer
          software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) which
          you may have access to as part of, or through your use of, the Services are the sole
          responsibility of the person from which such content originated. All such information is
          referred to below as the “Content.”
        </p>
        <p>
          7.2 You should be aware that Content presented to you as part of the Services, including
          but not limited to advertisements in the Services and sponsored Content within the
          Services may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the sponsors
          or advertisers who provide that Content to Google (or by other persons or companies on
          their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create
          derivative works based on this Content (either in whole or in part) unless you have been
          specifically told that you may do so by Google or by the owners of that Content, in a
          separate agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.3 Google reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag,
          filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all Content from any Service. For some of the
          Services, Google may provide tools to filter out explicit sexual content. These tools
          include the SafeSearch preference settings (see
          https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/510?hl=en). In addition, there are
          commercially available services and software to limit access to material that you may
          find objectionable.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.4 You understand that by using the Services you may be exposed to Content that you may
          find offensive, indecent or objectionable and that, in this respect, you use the Services
          at your own risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility
          to you or to any third party for) any Content that you create, transmit or display while
          using the Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage
          which Google may suffer) by doing so.

          wherever in the world those rights may exist).
        </p>
        <p>
          8.2 Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Google, nothing in the Terms gives
          you a right to use any of Google’s trade names, trade marks, service marks, logos, domain
          names, and other distinctive brand features.
        </p>

          separate written agreement with Google, then you agree that your use of such features
          shall be in compliance with that agreement, any applicable provisions of the Terms, and
          Google's brand feature use guidelines as updated from time to time. These guidelines can
          be viewed online at http://www.google.com/permissions/guidelines.html (or such other URL
          as Google may provide for this purpose from time to time).

        <p>
          8.4 Google acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you
          (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content that you submit, post,
          transmit or display on, or through, the Services, including any intellectual property
          rights which subsist in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or
          not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise
          in writing with Google, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing
          those rights and that Google has no obligation to do so on your behalf.

        <p>
          8.6 Unless you have been expressly authorized to do so in writing by Google, you agree
          that in using the Services, you will not use any trade mark, service mark, trade name,

          confusion about the owner or authorized user of such marks, names or logos.

          a security interest in or over your rights to use the Software, or otherwise transfer any
          part of your rights to use the Software.

        </p>
        <p>
          11.1 The Software which you use may automatically download and install updates from time
          to time from Google. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop
          the Services and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced functions, new software modules
          and completely new versions. You agree to receive such updates (and permit Google to
          deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Services.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          (A) you have breached any provision of the Terms (or have acted in manner which clearly
          shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of the
          Terms); or
        </p>
        <p>
          (B) Google is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Services
          to you is, or becomes, unlawful); or
        </p>
        <p>
          (C) the partner with whom Google offered the Services to you has terminated its
          relationship with Google or ceased to offer the Services to you; or

        <p>
          (D) Google is transitioning to no longer providing the Services to users in the country

        <p>
          (E) the provision of the Services to you by Google is, in Google’s opinion, no longer

          accrued over time whilst the Terms have been in force) or which are expressed to continue
          indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 19.7
          shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.

        <p>
          18.1 Google may make changes to the Universal Terms or Additional Terms from time to

          available at http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/eula_text.html and any new Additional
          Terms will be made available to you from within, or through, the affected Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          18.2 You understand and agree that if you use the Services after the date on which the
          Universal Terms or Additional Terms have changed, Google will treat your use as
          acceptance of the updated Universal Terms or Additional Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>19. General legal terms</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          19.1 Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or in connection with
          your use of the Services) use a service or download a piece of software, or purchase
          goods, which are provided by another person or company. Your use of these other services,
          software or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the company or person
          concerned. If so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other
          companies or individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          19.2 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Google and govern
          your use of the Services (but excluding any services which Google may provide to you
          under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between
          you and Google in relation to the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          19.3 You agree that Google may provide you with notices, including those regarding
          changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          19.4 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy
          which is contained in the Terms (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable
          law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google’s rights and that those
          rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
        </p>
        <p>
          19.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that
          any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
          Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will
          continue to be valid and enforceable.
        </p>
        <p>
          19.6 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google
          is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that such other
          companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the
          Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
          person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          19.7 The Terms, and your relationship with Google under the Terms, shall be governed by
          the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
          You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within
          the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.
          Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for
          injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

          <strong>20. Additional Terms for Extensions for Google Chrome</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          20.1 These terms in this section apply if you install extensions on your copy of Google
          Chrome. Extensions are small software programs, developed by Google or third parties,
          that can modify and enhance the functionality of Google Chrome. Extensions may have
          greater privileges to access your browser or your computer than regular webpages,
          including the ability to read and modify your private data.
        </p>
        <p>
          20.2 From time to time, Google Chrome may check with remote servers (hosted by Google or
          by third parties) for available updates to extensions, including but not limited to bug
          fixes or enhanced functionality. You agree that such updates will be automatically
          requested, downloaded, and installed without further notice to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          20.3 From time to time, Google may discover an extension that violates Google developer
          terms or other legal agreements, laws, regulations or policies. Google Chrome will
          periodically download a list of such extensions from Google’s servers. You agree that
          Google may remotely disable or remove any such extension from user systems in its sole
          discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>21. Additional Terms for Enterprise Use</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          21.1 If you are a business entity, then the individual accepting on behalf of the entity
          (for the avoidance of doubt, for business entities, in these Terms, "you" means the
          entity) represents and warrants that he or she has the authority to act on your behalf,
          that you represent that you are duly authorized to do business in the country or
          countries where you operate, and that your employees, officers, representatives, and
          other agents accessing the Service are duly authorized to access Google Chrome and to
          legally bind you to these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          21.2 Subject to the Terms, and in addition to the license grant in Section 9, Google
          grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to reproduce, distribute, install,
          and use Google Chrome solely on machines intended for use by your employees, officers,
          representatives, and agents in connection with your business entity, and provided that
          their use of Google Chrome will be subject to the Terms.

          1. License Restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Flash Player, Version 10.x is designed only as a browser plug-in. Sublicensee may not
          modify or distribute this Adobe Software for use as anything but a browser plug-in for
          playing back content on a web page. For example, Sublicensee will not modify this Adobe
          Software in order to allow interoperation with applications that run outside of the
          browser (e.g., standalone applications, widgets, device UI).
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Sublicensee will not expose any APIs of the Flash Player, Version 10.x through a
          browser plug-in interface in such a way that allows such extension to be used to playback
          content from a web page as a stand-alone application.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The Chrome-Reader Software may not be used to render any PDF or EPUB documents that
          utilize digital rights management protocols or systems other than Adobe DRM.

          (d) Adobe DRM must be enabled in the Chrome-Reader Software for all Adobe DRM protected
          PDF and EPUB documents.

        <p>
          (e) The Chrome-Reader Software may not, other than as explicitly permitted by the
          technical specifications, disable any capabilities provided by Adobe in the Adobe
          Software, including but not limited to, support for PDF and EPUB formats and Adobe DRM.
        </p>
        <p>

          a web site, the Internet, an intranet, or similar technology (an, “Electronic

          Software by Sublicensee, including those on CD-ROM, DVD-ROM or other storage media and
          Electronic Transmissions, if expressly permitted, shall be subject to reasonable security
          measures to prevent unauthorized use. With relation to Electronic Transmissions approved
          hereunder, Sublicensee agrees to employ any reasonable use restrictions set by Adobe,
          including those related to security and/or the restriction of distribution to end users
          of the Sublicensee Product.
        </p>

          enforceable end user license agreement, in favor of Sublicensee and its suppliers
          containing at least each of the following minimum terms (the “End-User License”): (i) a
          prohibition against distribution and copying, (ii) a prohibition against modifications
          and derivative works, (iii) a prohibition against decompiling, reverse engineering,

        <p>
          4. Opensource. Sublicensee will not directly or indirectly grant, or purport to grant, to
          any third party any rights or immunities under Adobe’s intellectual property or
          proprietary rights that will subject such intellectual property to an open source license
          or scheme in which there is or could be interpreted to be a requirement that as a
          condition of use, modification and/or distribution, the Adobe Software be: (i) disclosed
          or distributed in source code form; (ii) licensed for the purpose of making derivative
          works; or (iii) redistributable at no charge. For clarification purposes, the foregoing
          restriction does not preclude Sublicensee from distributing, and Sublicensee will
          distribute the Adobe Software as bundled with the Google Software, without charge.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Additional Terms. With respect to any update, upgrade, new versions of the Adobe
          Software (collectively “Upgrades”) provided to Sublicenses, Adobe reserves the right to
          require additional terms and conditions applicable solely to the Upgrade and future
          versions thereof, and solely to the extent that such restrictions are imposed by Adobe on
          all licensees of such Upgrade. If Sublicensee does not agree to such additional terms or
          conditions, Sublicensee will have no license rights with respect to such Upgrade, and
          Sublicensee’s license rights with respect to the Adobe Software will terminate
          automatically on the 90th day from the date such additional terms are made available to
          Sublicensee.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Proprietary Rights Notices. Sublicensee shall not, and shall require its distributors
          not to, delete or in any manner alter the copyright notices, trademarks, logos or related
          notices, or other proprietary rights notices of Adobe (and its licensors, if any)
          appearing on or within the Adobe Software or accompanying materials.

          been verified by Adobe as set forth below.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Verification and Update. Sublicensee must submit to Adobe each Sublicensee product
          (and each version thereof) containing the Adobe Software and/or Upgrade (“Sublicensee
          Product”) that do not meet the Device Verification exemption criteria to be communicated
          by Google, for Adobe to verify. Sublicensee shall pay for each submission made by
          Sublicensee by procuring verification packages at Adobe’s then-current terms set forth at
          http://flashmobile.adobe.com/. Sublicensee Product that has not passed verification may
          not be distributed. Verification will be accomplished in accordance with Adobe’s
          then-current process described at http://flashmobile.adobe.com/ (“Verification”).
        </p>
        <p>
          9. Profiles and Device Central. Sublicensee will be prompted to enter certain profile
          information about the Sublicensee Products either as part of the Verification process or
          some other method, and Sublicensee will provide such information, to Adobe. Adobe may (i)
          use such profile information as reasonably necessary to verify the Sublicensee Product
          (if such product is subject to Verification), and (ii) display such profile information
          in “Adobe Device Intelligence system,” located at
          https://devices.adobe.com/partnerportal/, and made available through Adobe’s authoring
          and development tools and services to enable developers and end users to see how content
          or applications are displayed in Sublicensee Products (e.g. how video images appear in
          certain phones).
        </p>
        <p>
          10. Export. Sublicensee acknowledges that the laws and regulations of the United States
          restrict the export and re-export of commodities and technical data of United States
          origin, which may include the Adobe Software. Sublicensee agrees that it will not export
          or re-export the Adobe Software, without the appropriate United States and foreign
          governmental clearances, if any.
        </p>
        <p>
          11. Technology Pass-through Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Except pursuant to applicable permissions or agreements therefor, from or with the
          applicable parties, Sublicensees shall not use and shall not allow the use of, the Adobe
          Software for the encoding or decoding of mp3 audio only (.mp3) data on any non-pc device
          (e.g., mobile phone or set-top box), nor may the mp3 encoders or decoders contained in
          the Adobe Software be used or accessed by any product other than the Adobe Software. The
          Adobe Software may be used for the encoding or decoding of MP3 data contained within a
          swf or flv file, which contains video, picture or other data. Sublicensee shall
          acknowledge that use of the Adobe Software for non-PC devices, as described in the
          prohibitions in this section, may require the payment of licensing royalties or other
          amounts to third parties who may hold intellectual property rights related to the MP3
          technology and that Adobe nor Sublicensee has not paid any royalties or other amounts on
          account of third party intellectual property rights for such use. If Sublicensee requires
          an MP3 encoder or decoder for such use, Sublicensee is responsible for obtaining the
          necessary intellectual property license, including any applicable patent rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Sublicensee will not use, copy, reproduce and modify (i) the On2 source code
          (provided hereunder as a component of the Source Code) as necessary to enable the Adobe
          Software to decode video in the Flash video file format (.flv or .f4v), and (ii) the
          Sorenson Spark source code (provided hereunder as a component of the Source Code) for the
          limited purpose of making bug fixes and performance enhancements to the Adobe Software.
          All codecs provided with the Adobe Software may only be used and distributed as an
          integrated part of the Adobe Software and may not be accessed by any other application,
          including other Google applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) The Source Code may be provided with an AAC codec and/or HE-AAC codec (“the AAC
          Codec”). Use of the AAC Codec is conditioned on Sublicensee obtaining a proper patent
          license covering necessary patents as provided by VIA Licensing, for end products on or
          in which the AAC Codec will be used. Sublicensee acknowledges and agrees that Adobe is
          not providing a patent license for an AAC Codec under this Agreement to Sublicensee or
          its sublicensees.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) THE SOURCE CODE MAY CONTAIN CODE LICENSED UNDER THE AVC PATENT PORTFOLIO LICENSE FOR
          THE PERSONAL NON-COMMERCIAL USE OF A CONSUMER TO (i) ENCODE VIDEO IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE
          AVC STANDARD ("AVC VIDEO") AND/OR (ii) DECODE AVC VIDEO THAT WAS ENCODED BY A CONSUMER
          ENGAGED IN A PERSONAL NON-COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY AND/OR WAS OBTAINED FROM A VIDEO PROVIDER
          LICENSED TO PROVIDE AVC VIDEO. NO LICENSE IS GRANTED OR WILL BE IMPLIED FOR ANY OTHER
          USE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MAY BE OBTAINED FROM MPEG LA, L.L.C. See
          http://www.mpegla.com
        </p>
        <p>
          12. Update. Sublicensee will not circumvent Google’s or Adobe’s efforts to update the
          Adobe Software in all Sublicensee’s products incorporating the Adobe Software as bundled
          with the Google Software (“Sublicensee Products”).
        </p>
        <p>
          13. Attribution and Proprietary Notices. Sublicensee will list the Adobe Software in
          publicly available Sublicensee Product specifications and include appropriate Adobe
          Software branding (specifically excluding the Adobe corporate logo) on the Sublicensee
          Product packaging or marketing materials in a manner consistent with branding of other
          third party products contained within the Sublicensee Product.
        </p>
        <p>
          14. No Warranty. THE ADOBE SOFTWARE IS MADE AVAILABLE TO SUBLICENSEE FOR USE AND
          REPRODUCTION “AS IS” AND ADOBE MAKES NO WARRANTY AS TO ITS USE OR PERFORMANCE. ADOBE AND
          ITS SUPPLIERS DO NOT AND CANNOT WARRANT THE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS OBTAINED BY USING THE
          ADOBE SOFTWARE. EXCEPT FOR ANY WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION OR TERM TO THE EXTENT
          TO WHICH THE SAME CANNOT OR MAY NOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY LAW APPLICABLE TO
          SUBLICENSEEIN SUBLICENSEE’S JURISDICTION, ADOBE AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTIES,
          CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, OR TERMS (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WHETHER BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW,
          CUSTOM, USAGE OR OTHERWISE) AS TO ANY MATTER INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION NONINFRINGEMENT
          OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY, INTEGRATION, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OR FITNESS FOR
          ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SUBLICENSEE AGREES THAT SUBLICENSEE SHALL NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTY,
          EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ON BEHALF OF ADOBE.
        </p>
        <p>
          15. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL ADOBE OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO
          SUBLICENSEE FOR ANY DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS WHATSOEVER OR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT,
          OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS, EVEN IF AN ADOBE
          REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS, DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS
          OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY TO
          THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN SUBLICENSEE’S JURISDICTION. ADOBE’S AGGREGATE
          LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE

          Adobe’s liability to Sublicensee in the event of death or personal injury resulting from
          Adobe’s negligence or for the tort of deceit (fraud). Adobe is acting on behalf of its
          suppliers for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding and/or limiting obligations,
          warranties and liability as provided in this Agreement, but in no other respects and for
          no other purpose.

        <p>
          “Content Protection Functions” means those aspects of the Adobe Software that are
          designed to ensure compliance with the Compliance and Robustness Rules, and to prevent
          playback, copying, modification, redistribution or other actions with respect to digital
          content distributed for consumption by users of the Adobe Software when such actions are
          not authorized by the owners of such digital content or its licensed distributors.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Content Protection Code” means code within certain designated versions of the Adobe

          “Key” means a cryptographic value contained in the Adobe Software for use in decrypting
          digital content.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) License Restrictions. Sublicensee’s right to exercise the licenses with respect to
          the Adobe Software is subject to the following additional restrictions and obligations.
          Sublicensee will ensure that Sublicensee’s customers comply with these restrictions and
          obligations to the same extent imposed on Sublicensee with respect to the Adobe Software;
          any failure by Sublicensee’s customers to comply with these additional restrictions and
          obligations shall be treated as a material breach by Sublicensee.
        </p>
        <p>
          b.1. Sublicensee and customers may only distribute the Adobe Software that meets the
          Robustness and Compliance Rules as so confirmed by Sublicensee during the verification
          process described above in the Adobe Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          b.2. Sublicensee shall not (i) circumvent the Content Protection Functions of either the
          Adobe Software or any related Adobe Software that is used to encrypt or decrypt digital
          content for authorized consumption by users of the Adobe Software, or (ii) develop or
          distribute products that are designed to circumvent the Content Protection Functions of
          either the Adobe Software or any Adobe Software that is used to encrypt or decrypt
          digital content for authorized consumption by users of the Adobe Software.
        </p>

        <p>
          (d) Injunctive Relief. Sublicensee agrees that a breach of this Agreement may compromise
          the Content Protection Functions of the Adobe Software and may cause unique and lasting
          harm to the interests of Adobe and owners of digital content that rely on such Content
          Protection Functions, and that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate fully for
          such harm. Therefore, Sublicensee further agrees that Adobe may be entitled to seek
          injunctive relief to prevent or limit the harm caused by any such breach, in addition to
          monetary damages.
        </p>
